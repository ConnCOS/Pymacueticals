Module 5 challenge
This module challenge asks for data visualization for an animal study involving a range of drug regimens for 249 mice identified with SCC tumors. Tumor development was observed and measured, and the purpose of the study was to compare the performance of Pymaceutical drug company's drug of interest, Capomulin, against other drug regimens.
Among the data visualizations were bar charts showing the number of data points per drug regimen, the percentage of test subjects by gender, quartiles and boxplots showing drug regimen and total tumor volume, and a linear regression model for mouse weight and tumor volume.
Sources for completion of this work include Module 5 activities, a group Project 1 that included bar and pie charts, the website geekforgeeks in completing value extraction for a single cell, and for the last two cells, a public GitHub assignment by Jiu He.
